    "In this project, I work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. I'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. This makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important."

    "#### ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Why doesn't nearest neighbors work well for this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearest neighbor classifers do not work well with a large amount of features. There isn't a set amount of what defines a \"large\" amount, but the theory behind knn classifier is the distance between the nearest neighbor. Therefore the more features involved, the farther away the nearest neighbor may appear which makes it harder for the model to find the best features for prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Any ideas why logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes?\n",
    "It seems like logistic regression does not work because there are more features than the training examples and therefore the logistic regression model is overfitting. Naive Bayes works better in this case since it assumes independence between features and thus does not make false correlations between features for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. Logistic regression estimates a weight vector for each class, which you can access with the coef_ attribute. Output the sum of the squared weight values for each class for each setting of the C parameter. Briefly explain the relationship between the sum and the value of C.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of sum of squared weights for each class for each setting of C is listed above. As C gets larger in value, the size of the parameters of the logistic regression model increases in magnitude to adjust to the training data. Smaller values of C is associated with a smaller magnitude of errors."

The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
